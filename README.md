## Overview of Project

In this module we help Dana, a data journalist. She gets the chance to write about her hometown, and she capatilizes on her towns UFO sightings. In this module we utilize JavaScript to visualize tables, minipulate data by using filters, and display the information on a website. In the challenege the goal was to provide in-depth analysis and add filters for the city, state, country, and shape

## Results

Within my index.html file I added five filters wihtin the dive class = container fluid. Within each li class, I inputed the label and input type for each filter. I then went to my app.js file to create a variable for my gilters and then looped through the variable to add to the webpage.

## Summary 

There are some drawbacks with the update of the design is that the filtering isnt't user friendly. In order the iflter the user would first have to see all the results to determine which parameters are desired and then decide to filter from there. This is due to the fact that only certain locations are included. 

One way to fix this problem is to include a dropdown menu for each filter. This way the user will immediatley know the options available to filter the search results. 

I also believe that including a button to clear the filters will also be beneficial and will promote user ease of use.
